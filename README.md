# Team Honest playlists, 2012-2022

:sunglasses: :camping: :beers: :sun_with_face: 	:heart:

For >10 years of summer trips, Team Honest and friends have created collaborative playlists, where everyone secretly selects songs to add. 
During the drive up to our vacation spot, the playlist is both our background music and a guessing game of who picked which songs.

This R Shiny dashboard analyzes these playlists, examining variables like number of songs selected, artists with the most playlist appearances, song length, and the rare event of friends picking the same songs. 	:heart:
